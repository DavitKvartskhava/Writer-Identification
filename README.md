# Writer-Identification
Writer identification based on handwriting plays an important role in law enforcement investigations. Convolutional Neural Networks have been successfully applied to this problem throughout the last decade. Most of the research that has been done in this area has concentrated on extracting local features from handwriting samples and then combining them into global descriptors for writer retrieval/verification. This research aims to use Triplet CNNs to extract global feature vectors from images of handwritten text directly, eliminating the intermediate step involving local features. Extracting local features from small patches of handwriting samples is a reasonable choice considering the lack of big training datasets. However, the methods for aggregating local features are not perfect and do not take into account the spatial relationship between small patches of handwriting. Extracting global features from handwriting samples is not a novel idea, but this approach has never been combined with Triplet architecture. Training the CNNs to learn the global descriptors requires a large amount of training data, so I plan to use data augmentation techniques to enlarge the database by a factor of 100. The method will be evaluated on the accuracy of identification on the ICDAR 2013, CVL and IAM datasets.
